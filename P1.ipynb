    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "- This was a fun project. Even though I was already familiar with Hough Transform, I learned a bit more about Hough Transform by fiddling with parameters. Parameter tuning is probably one of the most important skills in Computer Vision. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Brief description of my current pipeline:\n",
    "  - I am first converting the color image (or a frame from a video) to a grayscale image. This enables us to work on a single channel of the image, instead of working on all 3 channels (BGR). So this is computationally less intensive\n",
    "  - Then I am applying Gaussian Blur to the image. I also tried Bilateral Filtering, since this filtering preserves edges better, compared to Gaussian Filter. However, I did not see a big advantage in this project, so I kept the Gaussian Filtering in my code to be consistent with given specifications. \n",
    "  - Then I applied Canny Edge detection on this smoothed image. \n",
    "  - To make this process more efficent, I used a small GUI tool. \n",
    "    Here's the demo of the tool: https://youtu.be/xdiekchp-Uc \n",
    "  - On this Edge image, I filtered region of interest by applying a mask. Since we are primarily interested in edges in the region where we expect our road to be, I removed the edges in other areas of the image. \n",
    "  - Then I applied Hough Lines algorithm on this masked edge image. This gives us line segments where we have edges near the lane lines\n",
    "  - Once I get the lane line segments, I extrapolated the left lane line and right lane line, based on the angle. \n",
    "  - Since we are using Polar coordinates in Hough Transform, our left line will have negative slope and the right line will have positive slope. Based on this, I classify each line segment to be either a left line segment or a right line segment. Then I take average of all left line segments and draw an extrapolated left line. I apply same method for extrapolating the right line segment as well. To make the extrapolated lines more stable and less wobbly, I applied weighted sum of previous slope and current slope of each line. This allows smooth transitioning of the slope, so the outcome looks more stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I think using simply Hough Transform algorithm is not very robust for finding lane lines. For example, Hough Transform may not work well when there is cross-walk nearby or when parts of the road are not painted. Unless we implement Hyperbola fitting in Hough Transform, the algorithm may not work very well on curvy roads. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To make algorithm work better:\n",
    "  - We can probaly use K-means clustering in our region of interest. This will work well, if we simply want to follow our current lane. \n",
    "  - We can also do RANSAC. \n",
    "  - Another option could be using Histograms to do Sengmentation. "
